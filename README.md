# Analysis of Functional Brain Connectivity, Temporal Complexity, and Machine Learning of rsfMRI Features
This repository hosts the code implementations for various studies conducted by me ([omidvarnia](https://github.com/omidvarnia)) and my collaborators. These studies encompass investigations into functional brain connectivity, temporal complexity analysis of resting-state fMRI data, machine learning of rsfMRI features, and their associations with behavioral measures. The provided codes are essential for replicating our findings and analysis results across different databases, including the Human Connectome Project and UK Biobank. Researchers can utilize these resources to reproduce our studies and further contribute to the advancement of neuroimaging research.
